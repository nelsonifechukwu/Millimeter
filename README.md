How can we build a Smart Metering system for just under $40. This is a project as an entry into the Lagos smartmeter competition.

# Stages

- Building the Hardware
- Designing the Software

# Building the Hardware (Check the Complete Analysis.pdf for a quick overview)



+ Using an arduino for processing and GSM/GPRS module for internet connectivity

    - Make the necessary electrical connections
    - Upload the file at Arduino/Meter_main/Meter_main.ino to your arduino
 
+ Using an ESP32 for processing and internet connectivity 

    - Make the necessary electrical connections @ https://github.com/BSP-Embed/IoT-Energy-Meter -> Circuit Diagrams.
    - Upload the file at Arduino/Meter_ESP32/Meter_ESP32.ino to your ESP32 



# Designing the software

- Using the hosting platform 000webhost
 - Create your profile
